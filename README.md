# calpads
An experimental Python Web API wrapper for California Department of Education CALPADS.

# Supported Endpoints
* `Leas` - lists all(?) Leas
* A number of `/Students` endpoints are currently functional.

# Planned Experimentations
* The highest leverage and currently most difficult as far as I've scoped out is *drumroll* : `Reports` downloads
* `Extract` downloads: still tricky to get full coverage through the wrapper, but conceptually easier than `Reports`
* Switching between LEAs for users with access to multiple LEAs
* Extract/File Upload operations
